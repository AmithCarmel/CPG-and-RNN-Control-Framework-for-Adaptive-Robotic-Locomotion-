# CPG and RNN Control Framework for Adaptive Robotic Locomotion
Develop and validate a CPG (based control architecture combining population and rate coded phase decoding with RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks) based learning, and using PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization) Reinforcement Learning Algorithm to achieve adaptive gait generation, joint angle learning, and event driven locomotion for autonomous robots.
1. Install the python libraries using requirements.txt.
2. Run Walk_crawl.py on your host machine with proper connected device mac address.
3. Upload OpenCatESP32.ino firmware on the bittle Quadrapled bot.
